# Open SEO API

This project contains the website for [open-seo.org](https://www.open-seo.org)

This was a quick project to learn React.  I wanted to understand the react javascript library, but didn't want to make another todo app.

The API used for this project can be found at: [https://github.com/jluterek/open-seo-api](https://github.com/jluterek/open-seo-api)

The blog on the website can be found at: [https://github.com/jluterek/open-seo-blog](https://github.com/jluterek/open-seo-blog)

I'd love to get your feedback or suggestions on the website.  I also accept guest posts for the blog.
